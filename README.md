Smoking done in non-smoking areas can be hazardous for the active smokers as well as the passive smokers. In a place like a medical laboratory, it might be difficult to track smokers in human absence. If a person happens to smoke in such an area, this could lead to any mishap such as fire accidents because of the presence of flammable chemicals.
This survey paper has represented a model that detects smoking gestures on the places it is prohibited using deep learning and implements an application that sends a notification to notify authorities of the violation of rule.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Smoking is a risk factor for mortality from several medical causes. Cigarette smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke are associated with premature death, and a substantial burden on the health-care system.
Since smoking is banned in public areas still some people violate this rule and smoke in the no smoking zones. 

Objective :- 

The objective is to propose a technology driven solution that will help in identifying those people and generate an alert to the concerned authorities.

PROPOSED SOLUTION

We propose a system of real time tracking for surveillance in order to recognize humans, objects, and smoke. The A.I. asks itself if the observed object has the characteristics as the reference images such as smoking gestures with a cigarette like object. The artificial intelligence ("A.I.") sends an alert to the concerned authorities if it detects the breaking of the "rule" that no person is allowed to smoke in that area.

TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

Tool used for the implementation of the project is Jupyter Notebook (Python).
Two main techniques used are:-
Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets or CNNs) is one of the main categories to do images recognition, images classification.  

Resnet34 is a 34 layer convolutional neural network that can be utilized as a state-of-the-art image classification model.
